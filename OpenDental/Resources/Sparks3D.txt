Sparks3D is a DirectX 11 plugin for Open Dental that is licensed separately.  Open Dental will still work fine without this plugin, but the older 3D "SparksToothChart" will require the user to install the DirectX 9 SDK.  To make the newer Sparks3D plugin work, the following two files must be present in the Sparks3D folder within the application folder:  Sparks3D.dll and Sparks3DXEngine.dll.  To disable the plugin for troubleshooting, rename the folder temporarily.
